<div class="content">
<p>
  I am currently a Postdoctoral Associate at the 
  <a href="https://nyuair.github.io/website/">NYU Embodied AI and Robotics Lab</a> at New York University (NYU) 
  and the 
  <a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/center-for-artificial-intelligence-and-robotics.html">
    Center for AI and Robotics (CAIR)
  </a> at NYU Abu Dhabi (NYUAD), working under the supervision of <a href="https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/yi-fang.html"> Prof. Yi Fang</a>. 
  I am also a Visiting Research Fellow at the 
  <a href="https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/">Harvard AI and Robotics Lab</a> at Harvard University, 
  under the guidance of <a href="https://wang.hms.harvard.edu/team/dr-wang/"> Prof. Mengyu Wang</a>. I earned my Ph.D. in Cartography and Geographic Information System in 2021 from the 
  University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and the Aerospace Information Research Institute (AIR), 
  Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), where I was admitted through recommendation. 
  During my doctoral studies, I had the privilege of being a visiting scholar at the 
  <a href="https://ai4ce.github.io/">NYU AI4CE Lab</a> at New York University (NYU), mentored by <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng"> Prof. Chen Feng</a>.
</p>


<p>My research is driven by a vision to create AI systems that are reliable, equitable, and beneficial to society. This mission guides my exploration of both foundational advancements in AI and their interdisciplinary applications. I focus on 2D/3D computer vision, multimodal large language models, and spatiotemporal data mining, applying these technologies to address complex challenges in robotics, remote sensing, healthcare, geospatial analysis, and urban planning. With a commitment to fostering trustworthy AI systems that prioritize accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and fairness, my work bridges theoretical innovation with practical impact. To date, I have published over 50 research papers in top-tier conferences such as NeurIPS, ICCV, ECCV, AAAI, ICRA, and IROS, as well as leading journals like TVCG, TCSVT, TMM, TIM, GRSM, ISPRS, and ESSD.</p>
